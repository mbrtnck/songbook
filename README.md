# songbook

A collection of song lyrics along with guitar chords for single guitar
accompaniment. Everything in convenient, printer-friendly text format.
Included guitar chords are my own interpretation based on what I hear
and what I can play; and since I don't have any formal musical
background, they may be slightly different than the original ones. You
have been warned!

them here for my own convenience. Feel free to use all the goods as you
need.
