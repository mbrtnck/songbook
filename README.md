# songbook

A collection of song lyrics along with guitar chords for single guitar
accompaniment. Everything in convenient, printer-friendly text format.
Included guitar chords are my own interpretation based on what I hear
and what I can play; and since I don't have any formal musical
background, they may be slightly different than the original ones. You
have been warned!

I use German notation, so the tone between A and C is H, and the
semitone between A and H is B. See below for clear picture.
